# TRADING
idk what in entirety to do but i know i need to have deliverables, those will b here

the most actionable and efficient tasks would be to have a 20trade backtest completed 
this prevents me from looking at the same, exact, pairs friday, saturday, and sunday ... doing the same thing over and over.

so, at the least hit 5 trades logged if wanting to be stimulated by trading
